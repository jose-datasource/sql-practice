This folder contains SQL queries created as part of my Data Analytics training.

The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate core SQL skills commonly used in data analyst roles.

### Topics covered
- Basic SELECT statements
- Data filtering with WHERE
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- Grouping data with GROUP BY
- Sorting and limiting results with ORDER BY and LIMIT

### Files overview
- `basic_select.sql` – Basic SELECT queries
- `02_where_filters.sql` – Filtering data using WHERE
- `03_aggregations.sql` – Aggregations and GROUP BY
- `04_order_by_limit.sql` – Sorting and limiting results

### Notes
The queries are written using realistic table structures (customers, orders) to reflect real-world business scenarios.
